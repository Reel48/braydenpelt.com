## Power Scarcity

Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that U.S. data center demand will reach 45 GW by 2030, driven by a 15% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in power demand specifically for AI.

McKinsey's predictions are similar, projecting a 2.7x increase in terawatt-hours of electricity demand by 2030 (figure 1).

They go on to predict that the share of total US power demanded by AI data centers will also grow 2.25x in the same time period (figure 2).

**To put this in perspective, the entire current installed base of U.S. data centers is being tasked with doubling or tripling its capacity within a decade.** The bottleneck is physical: transformers, substations, and high-voltage transmission lines have lead times ranging from 3 to 7 years. Consequently, existing energized sites—even those originally built for lower-tier workloads like crypto mining—have accrued a massive "time-to-market" premium.

The fundamental constraint is no longer silicon availability, but power availability. While NVIDIA has ramped up production of H100 and Blackwell GPUs, the timeline to energize a new data center has lengthened significantly. In major markets like Northern Virginia, vacancy rates have plummeted to near-zero levels (1.6% in H1 2025), and power utilities are imposing multi-year wait times for new transmission connections.

**With 1 GW of total capacity at its Corsicana facility, Riot possesses one of the most valuable undeveloped power assets in North America.**
